    <textarea rows="50" cols="30" placeholder="Please input some text">As for the consonants, few of the previous studies that have been done even bother about them. Of the handful which do
    address them, consonants are generally taken whole as a group and dismissed with the statement that no particular color
    trend emerges for any particular consonant, and that, in general, the consonants are paler and grayer than the vowels.
    My own research indicates that it is indeed the case that, in general, the consonants are paler and far more often
    gray; however, a look at each consonant letter individually reveals that a handful of them do actually show color
    trends to greater or lesser degrees.
