# Hover vs Checkbox(index.html) 

  from a [codepen](https://codepen.io/anadebarros/pen/JbXZLo?editors=1100#0)

  The pen's author explanation: Just a small exercise with HTML and CSS that tries to materialize my synesthesia using either the hover pseudo class over letters or a checkbox state. The colors you see are the actual colors I project in my head for each letter (well, approximately..synesthesia can be very complex, trust me).
